# Purpose

This homework is designed to deepen your understanding of graph algorithms, greedy strategies, and dynamic programming. You will model real-world scenarios using computational abstractions and implement algorithms to solve them efficiently. The problems simulate settings from epidemiology to infrastructure planning and robotics, promoting algorithmic thinking and practical problem-solving.

By completing this homework, you will strengthen your ability to:  
- Model real-world problems as algorithmic challenges.  
- Apply graph traversal and optimization techniques.  
- Design and implement greedy and dynamic programming algorithms.  
- Evaluate algorithm performance through complexity analysis and visual simulations.

These align with institutional learning goals and support the Computer Science program's outcomes by promoting technical fluency, problem-solving, and analytical reasoning.

### ðŸŽ¯ Skills  
This homework helps build the following skills:

- Graph Algorithms & Modeling: Represent and process networks using graph structures and BFS, DFS, and All-Pairs Shortest Paths.  
- Algorithm Design & Analysis: Apply greedy and dynamic programming techniques to find optimal or efficient solutions.  
- Visualization & Communication: Use Python and libraries like `matplotlib` and `networkx` to visualize search processes, spanning structures, and simulation outcomes.
